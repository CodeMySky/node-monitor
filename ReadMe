Node-monitor
==================
Crawler part
------------------
### Caution
- Configure self.__cnf before use.
- Not a bit output until fatal error. (If you want to debug, please add debug collector and flush it when break. Explicitly add sys.exit(). At least that's what I do. Any trouble? **Go for leon!**)

### Todo
- Add it to cron.
- Make it more robust
- More test

### Caution
- Use redis to receive info. Channel name is ip.
- You may simply rewrite it all over.

### Todo
